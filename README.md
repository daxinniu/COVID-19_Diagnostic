# COVID-19_Diagnostic
This project uses Chest X-Ray Data to train a deep neural network to help diagnose COVID-19.

There is no substantially-sized, clinically verified, and publicly available COVID-19 dataset. However, a small composite dataset with X-Rays of COVID-19 positive patients recently became publicly available with DeepCovid, which compiled their data from:

Covid-Chestxray-Dataset(https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) for COVID-19 X-ray samples

ChexPert Dataset(https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) for Non-COVID samples
